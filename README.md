# nadiarashad-ToteWeatherApp

Welcome to my first attempt at a React Native application! Please run the app in the browser as that is what I used to test.

This is a React-Native based weather App, it uses geo location to give the user their current location weather data and also allows the user to input a location of their choice to retrieve new data.

The weather data (e.g. humidity, wind speed, sunrise and more) is displayed using the react-native-snap-carousel to avoid the user having to scroll through pages of content.

The backend uses the Open Weather API, https://openweathermap.org/api.
